The *bow-tie* problem. \n    - Consider this example of a network exhibiting a bow-tie topology:\n    ![alt text](image-3.png)\n    - A SCC (strongly connected component) lays in the center, with firms closely interconnected with one another; two firms (1) and (6) are not part of the SCC and are only loosely connected to the SCC through a single connection\n    - Applying the group ownership model on this example demonstrates the bow-tie problem\n        - Suppose that the underlying value of each firm is 1: the column vector $v = (1,1,1,1,1,1)$.\n        - Using the ownership matrix given above, the uncorrected integrated value and network values are given to be\n        ![alt text](image-4.png)\n        which are disproportionately high considering that the total underlying value of the network is $1+1+1+1+1+1=6$, but e.g. the network value of the 5th firm reaches 55, an order of magnitude larger.\n        - Introducing the correction operator![alt text](image-5.png)\n        leads to the corrected integrated and network values\n        ![alt text](image-6.png)\n        reduced by approx. one order of magnitude.\n    - The issue lies with firm 1: it is not part of the SCC and only owns a very small share in firm 2, as shown. However, the correction operator does not correct its values at all (because firm 1 is a *root node*, a node where there are no incoming connections) and thus the integrated value and network values of firm 1 are both the largest among the group after corrections\n        - The formula for integrated value means that as firm 1 owns a small share of firm 2 (part of the SCC), the integrated value of the entire SCC is added to firm 1\n    - This is clearly undesireable, as firm 1 is not very involved in the group and should not have this high of a network value","n":0.057}}},{"i":9,"$":{"0":{"v":"Complex Networks","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"## Complex networks\n- <span style=\"background-color: #03cafc; color: black;\">(Definition.)</span> Complex systems = networks with many interacting/moving parts\n    - Properties of the whole may appear that are not evident from the parts, through *emergence*\n    - Difficult to devise analytical solutions for\n    - Can be described most easily through the interactions between agents, i.e. through a graph\n- <span style=\"background-color: #03cafc; color: black;\">(Definition.)</span> Three levels of network analysis:\n    - Level 1: purely topological; two nodes are either connected or not connected, with no weights.
