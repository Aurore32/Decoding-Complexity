<li><span style="background-color: #03cafc; color: black;">(Definition.)</span> Complex systems = networks with many interacting/moving parts
<ul>
<li>Properties of the whole may appear that are not evident from the parts, through <em>emergence</em></li>
<li>Difficult to devise analytical solutions for</li>
<li>Can be described most easily through the interactions between agents, i.e. through a graph</li>
</ul>

<li><span style="background-color: #03cafc; color: black;">(Definition.)</span> Three levels of network analysis:
<ul>
<li>Level 1: purely topological; two nodes are either connected or not connected, with no weights. Adjacency matrix is binary (only 0s and 1s)</li>
<li>Level 2: links can have information (weights and direction). Adjacency matrix can have any numbers.</li>
<li>Level 3: nodes themselves can have information.
<ul>
<li>Analyzing networks at level 2 may reveal <em>bow-tie structures</em>, i.e. a core-periphery structure of the graph where a central section is strongly interconnected and the side sections are not</li>
<li>This is called a SCC (strongly connected component)
