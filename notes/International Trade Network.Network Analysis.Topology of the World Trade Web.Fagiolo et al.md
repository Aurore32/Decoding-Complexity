### Literature review

- WTN characterized by disassociativity: countries with many trade partners are connected with countries with few partners (negative degree-degree correlation)
    - i.e. node degree negatively correlated with average nearest neighbor degree (ANND)
- Well-connected nations are less interconnected than poorer ones
    - i.e. node degree negatively correlated with clustering coefficient
- These conclusions are predicated on a simple binary adjacency matrix view of the WTN; a weighted-network analysis may be performed instead

### Methods and Statistics

> <span style="background-color: #bc42f5; color: black;">Methods</span>.

- Node degree (and node strength), denoted ND/NS.
- Average neighbor node degree.
- Clustering coefficient

> <span style="background-color: #12ffd7; color: black;">Results</span>.

-  Majority of existing connections are relatively weak. High average ND while low average NS. ND and NS only weakly correlated ($R^2 = 0.5$).
- ND bimodal, weakly left-skewed; NS strongly left-skewed, many weak relationships coexist with few strong ones
- ND and ANND display -0.95 correlation (strongly negative); however, NS and ANNS are only weakly negatively correlated (-0.4)
- Clustering coefficient is actually **positively correlated** with NS; generally weakly clustered, unlike the binary WTN
